    "# Mediterranean restaurants in Germany\n",
    "__1. Introduction and Busniness problem__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem Background__\n",
    "\n",
    "During last decades have many people decided to immigrate mainly for security und financial reasons. To the list of the common immigration countries was Germany added. Because of the instability in the middle east caused by the so called arab spring, peaple from all age categories have leaved their countries legally or illegally to the nearest safe continent, namely Europe. The European union have failed to find solution to devide the immigrants from middle east and north Afrika equally between the european countries. Therefore each country made his own decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "For financial , demographic and humanitarian reasons landed the most part of the immigrants in Germany. This peaple comme from other cultures, speak other languages and have other caracteristics. This open new investment opportunities like language courses, Translater, clothings , special spices, Integration courses...etc\n",
    "\n",
    "__Problem description__\n",
    "\n",
    "Opening a Restaurant in Germany is a business that could make high profit and make immigrants feeling like at home. The is some factors that must be taken in consideration in order to open a successful restaurant:\n",
    "\n",
    "Repartition of immigrants in Germany Cuisines that immigrants likely enjoy Repartions of similiar restaurant in Germany We need to find the best location to open a restaurant.\n",
    "\n",
    "__2. Data__\n",
    "\n",
    "Data 1: \n",
    "The number of Habitants coming from Mediterranean countries in their repartition in Germany. This Data is provided for free in [Mediterranean population in Germany](https://www-genesis.destatis.de/genesis/online?operation=statistic&levelindex=0&levelid=1593532730678&code=12521#abreadcrumb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data 2:\n",
    "The cities in each State [Cities in Baden-Württemberg](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liste_der_Land-_und_Stadtkreise_in_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "The venues , their locations and their categories . This is provided in Foursquare for free.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Methodology__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Business Undestanding__\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this project is to find the best location in Germany to open a Restaurant which specialised in mediterranean cuisine.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Analytic Approach__\n",
    "\n",
    "In ordner to find the best place to open a Restaurant for mediterranean we will first try to find out where the mediterranean people are most located. In second part we will look what kind and how much restaurants are provided in the region where the mediterranean people live.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Exploratory Data Analysis__\n",
    "\n",
    "Data 1: Mediterranean Population in Germany\n",
    "\n",
    "The provided Data represents all people in Germany who come from other countries from all over the world, their age , gender and State. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc1.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to extract only Information about peaple from the Mediterranean region, we first made a list the countries located in the region.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc2.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Afer eliminating irrelevant countries and since the Gender and status don't influence the results, we have added all columns of the Table over each row ( each country) to get the total number of from this country living in Germany. After that we grouped all colums by State in order to get the repartition of mediterranean people in Germany over the States, like the folowing table shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc3.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Data 2: The effective surface in each State\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate the density of this people in each State, we need Informations about the area where they leave. Since there is in some states more forest, industries..etx than others, we have taken into account only Surfaces where peaple can live and spend free time and go eat. After substructing the irrelvant surfaces we have this summerized the Data in the folowing Table. here are the relevant surfaces in each State.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc4.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we added all this surfaces over the States \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc5.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have the effective surface of each state and the number of mediterreanean peaple in each speace we can now calculte the densitiy of this peaple in each State\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc6.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As we see this Data has different ranges. This may be inconvenient for the visualisation. Therefore this Data need to be normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc7.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can visualise this Data. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc8.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Insights from this Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Nordrhein-Westfale, Baden-Württemberg, Bayern and Hessen are the States the most mediterranean Population\n",
    "2. In Hessen and Baden-Württemberg is the ratio Density over Area larger\n",
    "3. The largest ratio Density over Area is in Baden-Württemberg.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data 3: Mediterranean Restaurants in Baden-Württemberg\n",
    "\n",
    "In the folowing we well analyse Data related to the State Baden-Württemberg in order to find out which city is well suited for an new Restaurant for mediterranean cuisine.\n",
    "Since the state is too big to fetch all relevant restaurants localted in it. We choose to analayse the Data of restaurants located in the urban districts of Baden-Württemberg. This make sense because also immigrants generelly prefer living in cities and not in villages. Therefo in the center of each cities will engender the most restaurants and relevant venues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of the urban districts in Baden-Württemberg.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc9.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "With the geolocator we get the longitude and the latitude of each urban district in order use ist for fetching informatiosn about venues from fouresquare\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc10.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Using fouresquare we exctract all venues in the listed urban district within a radius of 10 Km and a limit of 1000 results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc11.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This Data frame has 161 unique venue category. Then we filter by restaurant in order to get only food venues. Then filter out the restaurants that are irrelevant for mediterranean people. then we get 12 unique venue categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc12.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc13.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "After that we grouped the Venues by urban districts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Results:__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stuttgart, Mannheim, Karlsruhe and Heidelberg most relevant venues\n",
    "2. Geographically Mannheim and Heidelberg near to each other. Therfore the number of restaurants can be added.\n",
    "3. Stuttgart is a bigger urban district and isolated from the other ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc14.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sc15.png\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Discusssion:__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. opening a Restaurant near Heidelberg or Mannheim is quiet Riscky. But of we can get information about mediterranean people living there, we can make better decision.\n",
    "2. Stuttgart ist a good location for new restautant\n",
    "3. Freigburg is relativlely small city. There is also quit riscky to open a Restaurant.\n",
    "4. Mediterranean and Middle East specialities could be succesfull.\n",
    "5. Italian specialities are well provided ,so it's also risky to start such business.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Conclusion:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis of this Data my be wrong or incomplet since other larger information could be needed and better assumptions could be made. But with the provided analysis we can guarantee that a new restaurtant in Stuttgart for mediteranean specialities could be succesfull.\n"
